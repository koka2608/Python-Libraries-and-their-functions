# Python-Libraries-and-their-functions

Here in this repository I am adding pyhton files and their various functionalities.

All these are simple basic libraries used in Data Science and Machine Learning.

These arev the following libraries I will try covering. 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Cuffliny and Plotly



I hope anyone who coes through my Git enjoys these. 
Feel free to add any more content if you like. Always open to new suggestions.
